## Point system

> We are giving points for good habits and deducting 2x points for bad habits. 

There would be two sub system in points. 

1. Team Rule book -> these are those which have been decided as a necessity from all the members of the team, which they agreed upon to follow by whatever means necessary.
2. Personal Habits -> These are those which each member of the team would start and each completion will reward the point for completion. No limit of goals, if someone have 1 task then 1 point , if someone have 4 task and he/she completes all four of it then reward will be 4 points.
